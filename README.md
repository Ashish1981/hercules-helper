# Hercules-Helper

Utility scripts to help with building and deploying the Hercules emulator

These scripts extend the existing functionality of SDL-Hercules-390 gists/extpkgs.

This is a temporary testbed and will be merged into SDL-Hercules-390 and
its documentation when completed.

## hyperion-prepare.sh

This script will prepare a Linux system by installing the required
development tool packages.

## hyperion-buildall.sh

This script will perform a complete build of Hercules, and Regina Rexx,
and run all the automated tests.

```
./hyperion-buildall.sh --prompts
```
